# What

This is a hobby project

I always had an urge to develop a typing practice app for practicing and learning various Code Syntaxes. I know typing.io, however, I want to make it my own (9 dollars a month is alot ü§£ü´£), so that I can upload any code or text pieces to practice and drill keyboard typing. I have started a niche small project to achieve MVP, this will be my first Mac App üôå. If you have any thoughts please share it with me, thanks üôè
