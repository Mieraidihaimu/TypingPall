# What

This is a hobby project

I always had an urge to develop a typing practice app for practicing and learning various Code Syntaxes. I know typing.io, however, I want to make it my own (9 dollars a month is alot 🤣🫣), so that I can upload any code or text pieces to practice and drill keyboard typing. I have started a niche small project to achieve MVP, this will be my first Mac App 🙌. If you have any thoughts please share it with me, thanks 🙏

# Goal:

- Practice Any Natural & Programming language
    - Syntax syntax syntax!
    - Favorite Design Pattern
    - Algorithms, Data Structures, and more
    - Improve your chance in Tech and Coding interviews :joy
- Able to Upload you favorite scripts and codes
- Able to Persist your uploaded codes

I can do this all day.
